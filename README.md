## Beta program

This is currently **for early adopters** who like writing a bit of code to make an animated website. If that's you, [contact us](mailto:higelobi@gmail.com). We'd love to have you in the beta program!

## Demo

Take a look at [this page](http://gelobi.org/griddify) if you wanna see a demo. It's our first attempt to use TheatreJS in a real-world project.

## Installation, Docs, Tutortials
