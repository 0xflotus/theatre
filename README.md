# theatre.js
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AriaMinaei/theatrejs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/AriaMinaei/theatrejs)

A timeline-based animation editor for the web:

theatre.js allows animating any javascript variable, be it WebGL buffers, THREE.js objects, properties of DOM nodes, or controllers of a physics engine, in sync with audio tracks. All animations reside on a timeline, like other editing tools such as Adobe After Effects. You can effectively create clips and movies and have them run natively in a browser.

Other features include:
* A scene graph, where you can manage groups of actors, with each actor having multiple animatable properties.
* Workspaces, with each workspace configurable to contain selected actors and props.
* An auto-save feature, which uses git to save history, with a graphical interface to manage the entire history.

## State of the project
theatre.js is a work in progress. We're actively working on getting it ready for public release.
