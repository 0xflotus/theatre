## Demos

 Take a look at [this page](http://gelobi.org/griddify) if you wanna see a demo. It's our first attempt to use theatre.js in a real-world project!

## When will it release?

**This is a work-in-progress** and we're actively working on getting it ready for public release, so please stay tuned :)

Right now we have to partially replace two modules (the timeline data saver and the ui). Then `0.1` will be officially ready and we'll post installation instructions and tutorials.
