This file is only used by ESLint. We don't actually use it to configure babel in the build pipeline.

#### Why not?

Because we need different babel configs for packages like launcherBackend and launcherFrontend.

#### Why not just put a different `.babelrc` file in each package's folder?

Because some file belonging to launcherBackend, could be `import`ed by launcherFrontend. In that case, that file will have the babel config of launcherBackend, which may not necessarily be compatible with the config of launcherFrontend.

#### This makes me sad :(

Me too... :'(
