# Theatre.js

Theatre.js is an animation library for high-fidelity motion graphics. It is designed to help you express detailed animation, enabling you to create intricate movement, and convey nuance.

Theatre can be used both programmatically *and* visually:

Theatre works with all rendering stacks. You can use it to animate DOM elements, THERE.js objects, or any kind of JavaScript variable.
